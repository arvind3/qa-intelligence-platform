1,"Which duplicate families should we consolidate first?",ok,45505,100,"Summary: Local LLM could not initialize on this device, so this is a deterministic advisory response. Evidence: Top evidence IDs: TC-EX-0 (S-INV-10), TC-EX-1 (S"
2,"What are the top 3 coverage gaps by business risk?",ok,42257,100,"Summary: Coverage risk is likely concentrated where feature families have thin representation and inconsistent tagging. Evidence: Top evidence IDs: TC-EX-0 (S-I"
3,"Which suites are over-indexed with redundant tests?",ok,2233,100,"Summary: Duplicate pressure is best reduced by merging exact duplicates and parameterizing near-duplicate families. Evidence: Top evidence IDs: TC-EX-0 (S-INV-1"
